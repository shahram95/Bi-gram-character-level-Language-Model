# Bi-gram-character-level-Language-Model
This project implements a bigram character-level language model that learns character sequence probabilities. By predicting the next character based on the current one, it captures local text dependencies. Useful for generating text in a similar style, this project lays the groundwork for exploring fundamental language modeling concepts.
